              Our names are Angelo and Rachel and we’ve been taking an intro to
              web deisign class together. For our class we had to choose what
              kind of website we wanted create. We spent a lot of time thinking
              about it and we both agreed to create a website that would help
              and impact people in a postive way.
            </p>

              We’re both currently high school students in 10th grade. Rachel’s
              favorite subject is math, she likes working through challenges and
              learning new formulas. Angelo’s favorite subject is creative
              writing, he likes how it’s a way to express himself and he loves
              writing.

              Some of our hobbies that we have in common are reading and
              traveling. We love to travel because we get such a fresh
              experience from traveling to a new place because it’s usually
              different to what we’re use to. We also love reading anything such
              as articles, magazines, books, etc because they’re fun and
              interesting.

              We’ve both had times where we didn’t find self care important, and
              just didn’t know how to take care of our selves. Some of our
              website inspiration came from experiences that we had ourselves.
              This website is to help people with that same issue because we
              have been there, and we want to really bring awareness to
              everyone, especially teenagers.

              We hope that our website is able to do what it was designed to do
              which is to give people resources to take better care of
              themseleves because we matter so much, and sometimes people lose
              sight of that.
